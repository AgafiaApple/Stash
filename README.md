# Stash

**Note**: I appreciate any critique on how this application can be improved! 
## Introduction
Stash is a prototype trading app I built to learn app development and apply Software Engineering concepts. Users can track what items they have and borrow items from other users. 

## Background and Motivations
Stash started out as just a run-of-the-mill project for my Software Engineering class, but after lots of research and learning hurdles, it's become a very meaningful app. 

Once I started learning about Android application development and reading the documentation, I decided to make this app the training grounds for applying all of the Software Engineering concepts I was learning. 

This was much more difficult than I initially expected. At the start of the project, we were assigned an incomplete codebase that simulated outdated code that may be assigned to new developers. 

It was truly archaic, the code smells numerous, and the build.gradle files were completely alien to me as a beginner application developer. 

Because of those challenges and the quick learning required to understand and migrate to modern Android standards, I am very proud of this prototype. 

With that said, **I would be very grateful for any critique on how the app can be improved**. :)
